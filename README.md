## General info
The basics of working with text files in C++ using the `fstream` standard library. Program asks for 3 things: First name, last name, and a telephone number. Saves them all in `string` classes. Then creates a new file stream, creates file `dane.txt` in the memory for working with it, and saves each 3 saved `string`s in it on the disk. Each one is separated by a new line. There is also an option to append something in the file instead of recreating the file (uncomment the appriopriate section). Then the program closes the file and ends.
